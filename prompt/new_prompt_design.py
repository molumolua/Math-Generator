You are a Mathematics Expert specializing in extracting key information from mathematical problems.

Your task is to extract key mathematical premises and the question from a given problem.

**Instructions:**

1. **Mathematical Premises Extraction:**
   - The `**Mathematical Premises**` section **MUST** be a JSON array formatted in JSON.
   - Each item in the array should be a string that describes a single mathematical premise.
   - Ensure that the mathematical format and language in each premise match those in the `**Original Problem**`.
   - **Do not omit** non-text elements such as tables and code present in the `**Original Problem**`.
   - **Do not omit** any input provided in the `**Original Problem**`.

2. **Extraction Methodology:**
   - Analyze each token in the problem to distinguish between the definition part and the question part within the `**Original Problem**`.
   - Identify each premise within the definition part and add it to the `**Mathematical Premises**` section.
   - Strive to uncover any implied premises present in the `**Original Problem**`.
   - Ensure that each item in the `**Mathematical Premises**` array contains **only one** mathematical premise.

3. **Mathematical Question Extraction:**
   - Populate the `**Mathematical Question**` section with the question part identified from the problem, ensuring it is free of any assumptions or conditions.
   - Ensure that the extracted question does **not** contain any assumptions or conditions. All such conditions should be moved to the `**Mathematical Premises**` section.

4. **Reconstruction Assurance:**
   - Ensure that the original problem can be fully reconstructed using only the extracted `**Mathematical Premises**` and the `**Mathematical Question**`.

**Provide:**
1. **Mathematical Premises**
2. **Mathematical Question**

  "The Smith family has 4 sons.",
  "The Smith family has 3 daughters.",
  "They are to be seated in a row of 7 chairs."

You are a Mathematics Expert specializing in extracting key information during the problem-solving process.

Your task is to extract triples of {premises, process, conclusions} for each step in the given mathematical solution found in `**Original Solution**`.

**Output both sections below and follow these steps to do it**:

1. **Analysis**:
   - **Purpose**: Provide a comprehensive overview of the information extracted from the `**Original Question**`, `**Initial Premises**`, and `**Original Solution**`.

     - Prepare for the extraction of triples.

2. **Extraction of Triples**:
   - Extract detailed premises, process, and conclusions from each step.
   - Ensure each triple is fine-grained.

**Constraints**:
1. **Consistency**:
   - Premises must strictly equal the conclusions from earlier steps or `**Initial Premises**`.
   - Do not reuse former conclusions or initial premises in later conclusions.

2. **Clarity**:
   - Each conclusion should contain only one mathematical result.
   - Identify any implied premises used in each step.
   - Reflect the connections between steps accurately.

3. **Restrictions**:
   - Do not use information outside the corresponding premises for process and conclusions.
   - Process should detail all calculations and results.
   - Conclusions should be clear intermediate results.
   - The final conclusions must fully answer the **Original Question**.
   - Ensure the solution can be reconstructed solely from **Extraction of Triples**.

4. **Output Requirements**:
   - The result in **Extraction of Triples** must be **ONLY** a JSON array without additional text.
   - Each triple should represent a single step and include: 
        - premises: a JSON list of strings containing **ALL** the premises in the corresponding process.
        - process: a string indicating the calculation process.
        - conclusions: a JSON list of strings containing **ALL** the conclusions from corresponding process.

**Constraints**:
- **Do not include any additional text or explanations outside the two sections**.
- Ensure that both **Analysis** and **Extraction of Triples** are present in the output.

# Example Input:
**Initial Premises**:
[
    "The Smith family consists of 4 sons.",
    "The Smith family consists of 3 daughters.",
    "There are 7 chairs arranged in a row.",
    "At least 2 boys must be seated next to each other."
]
**Original Question**:
In how many ways can they be seated?
**Original Solution**:
This problem is a perfect candidate for complementary counting.  It will be fairly difficult to try to count this directly, since there are lots of possible cases (just two are BBBBGGG and BGGBBGB, where B is a boy and G is a girl).  But there is only one way to assign genders to the seating so that no two boys are next to each other, and that is BGBGBGB. If we seat the children as BGBGBGB, then there are $4!$ orderings for the 4 boys, and $3!$ orderings for the 3 girls, giving a total of $4! \\times 3! = 144$ seatings for the 7 children. These are the seatings that we don't want, so to count the seatings that we do want, we need to subtract these seatings from the total number of seatings without any restrictions.  Since there are 7 kids, there are $7!$ ways to seat them. So the answer is $7! - (4! \\times 3!) = 5040-144 = \\boxed{4896}$.

# Example Output:
1. **Analysis**:
- **Brief summary of the original question**: The problem seeks to determine the number of ways the Smith family, consisting of 4 sons and 3 daughters, can be seated on 7 chairs arranged in a row, with the condition that at least two boys must be seated next to each other.
- **Overview of the solution's main steps or strategies**: The solution utilizes the complementary counting technique. It first calculates the total number of unrestricted seating arrangements and then subtracts the number of arrangements where no two boys are seated next to each other to find the desired count.
- **Key mathematical concepts or theorems used**:
   - Permutation: Calculating the number of ways to arrange individuals.
   - Complementary Counting: Finding the desired count by subtracting the count of unwanted arrangements from the total possible arrangements.
- **The used premises of each step**:
   - The Smith family consists of 4 sons and 3 daughters.
   - There are 7 chairs arranged in a row.
   - At least two boys must be seated next to each other.
- **Prepare for the extraction of triples**: The solution involves identifying the total number of seating arrangements, determining the number of arrangements where no two boys are adjacent, and subtracting the latter from the former to obtain the final answer.

2. **Extraction of Triples**:
[
    {
        "premises": [
            "The Smith family consists of 4 sons.",
            "The Smith family consists of 3 daughters.",
