Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I look at the original problem. It involves distributing a negative sign, which is a fundamental algebraic operation. The solution provided does exactly that: removing the parentheses and distributing the negative to each term inside, resulting in \\(1 - 1 + x\\), which simplifies to \\(x\\).\n\nThe user wants me to create a simplified version, so I should consider making the problem more straightforward without unnecessary steps. Maybe I can eliminate the parentheses altogether. If I remove the brackets, the expression becomes \\(1 - 1 - x\\). This version skips the step of distributing the negative sign, making it a direct subtraction problem.\n\nNow, simplifying \\(1 - 1 - x\\) is straightforward. Subtracting 1 from 1 gives 0, leaving just \\(-x\\). This approach uses basic arithmetic and avoids the more complex step of handling negative signs with parentheses, making it more accessible for someone learning algebra.\n\nI should ensure that the simplified problem still has a unique answer, which it does since \\(-x\\) is the only solution. This change keeps the core concept of simplifying expressions but reduces the complexity by eliminating the distribution step.\n\nFinally, I present the simplified problem and solution clearly, making sure each step is logical and easy to follow.\n</think>\n\n**Simplified Problem**:  \nSimplify \\(1 - 1 - x\\).\n\n**Simplified Solution**:  \nStart with the expression: \\(1 - 1 - x\\).\n\nSubtract 1 from 1: \\(0 - x\\).\n\nSimplify the expression: \\(-x\\).\n\nThus, the simplified expression is \\(\\boxed{-x}\\).", "complex_process": "The transformation from the Original Problem to the Complexified Problem involved introducing parentheses around the second term, altering the order of operations and necessitating the distribution of a negative sign. This change converted the straightforward sequential subtraction into a problem requiring understanding of parentheses and sign distribution, thereby increasing its complexity and testing algebraic skills.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Original Problem:** Simplify \\(1 - 1 - x\\).\n   - Solution directly subtracts each term: \\(1 - 1 = 0\\), then \\(0 - x = -x\\).\n\n2. **Complexified Problem:** Simplify \\(1 - (1 - x)\\).\n   - Introduce parentheses around \\(1 - x\\), changing the structure.\n   - Distribute the negative sign over the parentheses: \\(1 - 1 + x\\).\n   - Combine like terms: \\(1 - 1 = 0\\), leaving \\(x\\).\n\n3. **Result:** The answer changes from \\(-x\\) to \\(x\\), demonstrating how parentheses affect the outcome.\n\nThis transformation enhances the problem by requiring an understanding of algebraic manipulation and the impact of parentheses on operations, making it more complex and educational."}
