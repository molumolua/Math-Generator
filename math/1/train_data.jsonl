Let me look at the original problem first. It's asking for the value of (2^2 * 2^-3) divided by (2^3 * 2^-2). The original solution uses exponent rules to simplify both the numerator and the denominator separately, then divides them, and ends up with 1/4.\n\nHmm, the main concepts here are the laws of exponents, specifically when multiplying and dividing like bases. Maybe I can make this problem simpler by using smaller exponents or more familiar numbers so that the calculations are easier for someone just starting out.\n\nLet me think, what if I use base 3 instead of 2? That might not make it simpler. Wait, maybe I should stick with base 2 but use exponents that are all positive or all negative? Or perhaps use exponents that when simplified, cancel out in a more straightforward way.\n\nWait, another approach could be to break it down into multiplication and division of fractions. Since exponents with negative powers can be converted to fractions, maybe writing each term as a fraction could make it more intuitive.\n\nSo, the numerator is 2^2 times 2^-3. 2^2 is 4, and 2^-3 is 1/8. So, 4 * 1/8 is 4/8, which simplifies to 1/2. In the denominator, 2^3 is 8, and 2^-2 is 1/4. So, 8 * 1/4 is 8/4, which is 2. Then, dividing numerator by denominator, it's (1/2) divided by 2, which is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.\n\nBut wait, the original solution already did it with exponents. Maybe I can simplify the problem by using smaller exponents so that the calculations are more straightforward. Let me try changing the exponents.\n\nWhat if I make the numerator 2^1 * 2^-2 and the denominator 2^2 * 2^-1? Let's see: numerator is 2^(1-2)=2^-1=1/2, denominator is 2^(2-1)=2^1=2. Then, dividing them: (1/2)/2 = 1/4. So the answer remains the same, but the problem becomes a bit simpler because the exponents are smaller. Maybe that's a good path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use numbers instead of exponents to make it even more basic. Like, instead of exponents, express each term as a product. For instance, 2^2 * 2^-3 could be written as (2*2) / (2*2*2), and similarly for the denominator. Then the problem becomes (4/8) divided by (8/4), which is (1/2) divided by 2, which is 1/4.\n\nWait, that might be a good way to simplify it. Instead of using exponent rules, actually compute each term as fractions. So, the problem would be ( (2^2)/(2^3) ) / ( (2^3)/(2^1) ). Hmm, but that might not be necessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can rephrase the problem as a single fraction by combining the numerator and denominator. So, the problem becomes (2^2 * 2^-3) / (2^3 * 2^-2) = (2^(2-3)) / (2^(3-2)) = 2^-1 / 2^1 = 2^(-1-1) = 2^-2 = 1/4.\n\nBut that's the same as the original solution. Maybe I need to present the problem in a way that doesn't require knowing the exponent rules. Like, breaking it down into multiplying and dividing fractions.\n\nSo, let me write the numerator as 2^2 times 2^-3, which is 2^(2-3) = 2^-1 = 1/2. The denominator is 2^3 times 2^-2 = 2^(3-2) = 2^1 = 2. So, it's (1/2) divided by 2, which is 1/4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write each term as a fraction without using negative exponents. So, 2^-3 is 1/2^3. Then, the numerator is 2^2 * (1/2^3) = (2^2)/(2^3) = 1/2. Similarly, the denominator is 2^3 * (1/2^2) = (2^3)/(2^2) = 2. Then, dividing 1/2 by 2 gives 1/4.\n\nSo, perhaps the simplified problem can be phrased in terms of multiplying and dividing fractions without explicitly using exponent rules. That might make it more accessible to someone who isn't as familiar with exponent properties.\n\nAlternatively, I could rephrase the entire expression as a single exponent. Since when you divide exponents with the same base, you subtract them, and when you multiply, you add. So, combining all that, the exponent becomes 2 - 3 - 3 + 2 = -2, so 2^-2 = 1/4.\n\nWait, but that's the same as the original solution, just phrased differently. Maybe I can present the problem by showing each step of combining the exponents one by one.\n\nFor example, in the numerator, 2^2 * 2^-3 is 2^(2 + (-3)) = 2^-1. In the denominator, 2^3 * 2^-2 is 2^(3 + (-2)) = 2^1. Then, dividing these gives 2^-1 / 2^1 = 2^(-1 -1) = 2^-2 = 1/4.\n\nSo, breaking it down step by step, adding exponents in the numerator and denominator separately, then subtracting.\n\nBut perhaps I can make it even simpler by using numbers that result in smaller exponents or more straightforward calculations. Maybe using 2^1 instead of 2^2 or 2^3.\n\nWait, let's try changing the exponents. Let me make the numerator 2^1 * 2^-1 and the denominator 2^1 * 2^-1. Then, both numerator and denominator would simplify to 2^(1-1)=2^0=1, so 1/1=1. But that's a different answer, so I don't want that.\n\nAlternatively, numerator: 2^3 * 2^-1, denominator: 2^2 * 2^-1. So numerator: 2^(3-1)=2^2=4, denominator: 2^(2-1)=2^1=2. Then, 4/2=2. Maybe that's too simple, but the problem would be (2^3 * 2^-1)/(2^2 * 2^-1)=2.\n\nBut the original answer is 1/4, so the simplified problem should still have the same answer. So, maybe I can adjust the exponents in a way that the process is similar but the numbers are smaller.\n\nWait, maybe the simplest way is to just compute each term numerically without using exponent rules. So, 2^2 is 4, 2^-3 is 1/8, so 4*(1/8)=1/2. Similarly, 2^3 is 8, 2^-2 is 1/4, so 8*(1/4)=2. Then, 1/2 divided by 2 is 1/4.\n\nSo, the problem can be rewritten as: Compute ( (2^2) * (2^-3) ) / ( (2^3) * (2^-2) ). And then, in the solution, compute each term as fractions and then divide.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the simplified problem can be presented as (4 * 1/8) / (8 * 1/4), which is (1/2) / (2) = 1/4.\n\nThat way, the problem doesn't require knowledge of exponent rules, just basic fraction multiplication and division.\n\nSo, I think the simplified problem can be phrased as a division of two products, each expressed as simple fractions, making it more approachable.\n\nSo, the problem would be: What is (4 * 1/8) divided by (8 * 1/4)?\n\nAnd the solution would be: First compute the numerator: 4 * 1/8 = 4/8 = 1/2. Then compute the denominator: 8 * 1/4 = 8/4 = 2. Then divide: (1/2) / 2 = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe present it as (2^2 * 1/2^3) / (2^3 * 1/2^2). That way, it's still using exponents but expressed as fractions, making it more straightforward for someone who might not remember the exponent subtraction rule.\n\nSo, the problem can be: What is (2^2 divided by 2^3) divided by (2^3 divided by 2^2)?\n\nAnd the solution would be: Numerator: 2^2 / 2^3 = 4/8 = 1/2. Denominator: 2^3 / 2^2 = 8/4 = 2. Then, 1/2 divided by 2 is 1/4.\n\nYes, that seems to simplify the problem by breaking it down into two separate fraction divisions, making it more accessible without needing to recall exponent rules.\n\nSo, the final simplified problem would be phrased as a division of two fractions, each involving powers of 2, which can be computed step by step.\n</think>\n\n**Simplified Problem**:\nWhat is \\(\\frac{2^2 \\div 2^3}{2^3 \\div 2^2}\\)?\n\n**Simplified Solution**:\nFirst, compute the numerator:\n\\[\n2^2 \\div 2^3 = \\frac{4}{8} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\nNext, compute the denominator:\n\\[\n2^3 \\div 2^2 = \\frac{8}{4} = 2\n\\]\nNow, divide the results:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}\\).", "complex_process": "The problem is simplified by applying exponent rules.

That should make it simpler because now there are only two factors to multiply instead of three.\n\nSo the original problem had eight wrapping papers, three ribbons, and four gift cards.

Maybe if I work from the innermost one outwards, it will make things clearer. The innermost part is (1 - x), right? So let's start there. If I replace that with something simpler, like just x, maybe the problem becomes easier.\n\nWait, but replacing (1 - x) with x would change the problem a bit. Maybe instead of trying to remove parts, I can adjust the structure to make it less nested. Instead of having four layers of parentheses, maybe I can simplify it to just one or two.\n\nLet me think about what each layer does. The original problem is 1 - (1 + (1 - (1 + (1 - x)))). If I simplify the innermost part, which is (1 - x), then the next layer is (1 + (1 - x)). That would be 1 + 1 - x, which is 2 - x.

Innermost is (1 - x). Then the next layer is (1 - (1 - x)) = x. Then the entire problem becomes 1 - x, which is the same answer as before. Wait, that works!

Let's check them:\n\n- 55: I know 55 is 5 times 11, so its prime factors are 5 and 11. The smallest is 5.\n- 57: I think 57 is 3 times 19, so the prime factors are 3 and 19. The smallest is 3.\n- 59: This seems like a prime number because I don't recall it being divisible by any other number except 1 and itself. So its only prime factor is 59.\n- 61: Similarly, 61 is also a prime number, so its only prime factor is 61.\n\nComparing the smallest prime factors:\n- 58: 2\n- 55: 5\n- 57: 3\n- 59: 59\n- 61: 61\n\nClearly, 2 is the smallest among these. Therefore, 58 has the smallest prime factor in the set B.\n\nI think I've covered all the numbers and identified their prime factors correctly. The key point here was recognizing that even numbers have 2 as a prime factor, which is the smallest possible. Since 58 is the only even number in the set, it must have the smallest prime factor.\n</think>\n\n**Simplified Problem**:\nSet $B = \\{55, 57, 58, 59, 61\\}.$ Which number in set B is even?\n\n**Simplified Solution**:\nTo find the even number in set $B$, we check each number:\n\n- $55$ is odd.\n- $57$ is odd.\n- $58$ is even because it ends with 8, which is divisible by 2.\n- $59$ is odd.\n- $61$ is odd.\n\nThus, the even number is $\\boxed{58}$.", "complex_process": "The smallest prime number is 2, which is a factor of every even number.
