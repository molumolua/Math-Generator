The original problem was pretty straightforward: \\(2^4 \\div 2^2\\). The solution used the exponent rule where dividing same-base exponents subtracts the exponents, so \\(2^{4-2} = 2^2 = 4\\). \n\nHmm, to make this more complex, I should introduce more operations or perhaps negative exponents. Let me think about how to add layers to the problem. Maybe instead of a simple division, I can create a fraction where both the numerator and the denominator are products of powers of 2, some with positive and some with negative exponents. That way, the student has to handle multiple steps: first simplifying the numerator and denominator separately using the multiplication rule (adding exponents) and then dividing by subtracting exponents.\n\nSo, perhaps something like \\(\\frac{2^2 \\cdot 2^{-3}}{2^3 \\cdot 2^{-2}}\\). Let me check if that works. In the numerator, combining the exponents would be \\(2^{2 + (-3)} = 2^{-1}\\), and the denominator would be \\(2^{3 + (-2)} = 2^1\\). Then, dividing those gives \\(2^{-1 - 1} = 2^{-2}\\), which is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\). That seems more involved and tests understanding of both multiplication and division of exponents, including negative exponents. \n\nI think that's a good step up from the original problem. It requires applying the exponent rules in multiple steps, which should challenge the student more than the original question. It also introduces negative exponents, which can be a point of confusion, making the problem more comprehensive. Yeah, that should work."}

Let's see, the original problem was about a gift shop with 3 types of wrapping paper and 2 colors of ribbon. They asked how many combinations there are when choosing one of each. The answer was 3 times 2, which is 6. \n\nHmm, to make this more complex, I can add more categories. Maybe include gift cards? That's another item people might choose. So, if I add gift cards, how many types should there be? Let's say four types. Now, the problem becomes choosing one wrapping paper, one ribbon, and one gift card.\n\nWait, but I should also adjust the numbers to make it a bit more involved. The original had 3 and 2, so maybe increase them a bit. Let me go with 8 varieties of wrapping paper, 3 ribbon colors, and 4 gift cards. That way, the multiplication would be 8 times 3 times 4, which is 96. \n\nLet me check if that makes sense. 8 times 3 is 24, and 24 times 4 is indeed 96. So the new problem would be asking for the total combinations when selecting one from each of the three categories. That should be more challenging than the original because it involves three variables instead of two. Also, the numbers are larger, which makes the multiplication a bit more complex for someone solving it.\n\nI think that's a good way to increase the problem's complexity. Adding another category and slightly larger numbers should make it a step up from the original."}

The question is how many pairings are possible when choosing one bowl and one glass.

Let's start by looking at the original problem. It's about map scales, which is a pretty standard topic in math. The problem states that the distance between two cities is 10 inches on the map, and the scale is 1 inch equals 5 miles. The solution is straightforward: multiply 10 by 5 to get 50 miles. That seems pretty simple, so I need to make it more challenging.\n\nFirst, I should think about what makes a problem more complex. Maybe I can change the scale so it's not a whole number. Instead of 1 inch equaling 5 miles, perhaps make it a fraction or a decimal. For example, if the scale is 0.25 inches equals 3 miles, that would require the student to do more calculations to find out how many miles one inch represents.\n\nSo, let's adjust the scale. Instead of 1 inch = 5 miles, I'll use 0.25 inches = 3 miles. This means that instead of a direct multiplication, the student has to first find the miles per inch by dividing 3 miles by 0.25 inches. That calculation would be 3 divided by 0.25, which equals 12 miles per inch. \n\nNow, changing the distance on the map as well. The original problem uses 10 inches, which is a nice round number. To add more complexity, I can make it 15 inches. So, the problem becomes: the distance on the map is 15 inches, and the scale is 0.25 inches equals 3 miles. How far apart are the actual cities?\n\nThis change requires the student to first compute the miles per inch, which is 12 miles per inch, and then multiply that by 15 inches. That gives 180 miles. \n\nLet me double-check to make sure this makes sense. If 0.25 inches is 3 miles, then 1 inch should be 12 miles because 3 divided by 0.25 is 12. Then, 15 inches would be 15 times 12, which is indeed 180 miles. That seems correct.\n\nSo, the complexified problem now involves a non-integer scale, which requires division to find the miles per inch, and a larger, still manageable number for the map distance. This should provide a bit more challenge than the original problem, especially for those just learning scale conversions.\n\nAnother thought: maybe I could make the scale even more complex, but I don't want it to be too difficult. Keeping it with a fraction that's a simple decimal (0.25) makes it manageable without being too overwhelming. If I used a more complicated fraction, like 0.125 inches, it might be too much for some students. So, 0.25 is a good balance between complexity and solvability.\n\nAlso, changing the distance from 10 to 15 inches adds a bit more work, but it's still within the same order of magnitude, so it's not too big a jump. It ensures that the student has to perform the multiplication with a larger number, which reinforces the concept of scaling up.\n\nI think this transformation effectively increases the problem's complexity by requiring the student to handle a fractional scale and a larger distance, thus testing their understanding of proportions and unit conversions more thoroughly."}

Finally, substitute back into the entire expression: \\(1 - (-1 - x) = 1 + 1 + x = 2 + x\\).\n\nThus, the simplified expression is \\(\\boxed{2 + x}\\).", "think": "Okay, so I need to figure out how to transform the Original Problem into the Complexified Problem. Let me start by understanding what the Original Problem was and how it was solved. The Original Problem was to simplify \\(1 - (2 - (3 + x))\\), and the solution involved working from the innermost parentheses outward, step by step. \n\nLooking at the steps, they started with \\(3 + x\\), then substituted back into the next layer, simplifying each step until they reached the final answer of \\(2 + x\\). The key here was the order of operations, focusing on the innermost parentheses first, then moving outward.\n\nNow, the Complexified Problem is \\(1 - (1 + (1 - (1 + (1 - x))))\\). I notice that this expression has more layers of parentheses, each introducing another level of complexity. Instead of a straightforward two layers, we have four layers here. Each layer alternates between addition and subtraction, which adds to the complexity.\n\nLet me think about how to create such a problem. Perhaps I can introduce more nested parentheses and alternate the operations to make each step require careful handling. The idea is to increase the number of steps and layers, making it more challenging for someone to simplify without making mistakes. \n\nStarting from the innermost part, each substitution would require handling both addition and subtraction, which could lead to sign errors if not carefully managed. For instance, in the Complexified Problem, each layer flips between adding and subtracting expressions, which might confuse someone if they don't keep track properly.\n\nI should also consider the structure. The Original Problem had three numbers (1, 2, 3) and a variable x. The Complexified Problem uses only 1s and x, which might make it seem simpler at first glance but actually requires more attention because of the repeated operations.\n\nThe solution process for the Complexified Problem involves five steps, each time peeling back a layer and simplifying. This demonstrates the importance of methodical step-by-step simplification, especially with multiple layers. Each step requires substituting the simplified inner expression back into the outer layer, carefully handling the signs each time.\n\nSo, the transformation from the Original Problem to the Complexified Problem involved increasing the number of nested parentheses, alternating operations, and using only a single number (1) and the variable x. This creates a problem that, while not inherently more difficult in terms of operations, requires more careful and detailed steps to solve correctly. It tests the solver's ability to manage multiple layers of operations and signs without error.\n\nI think this approach successfully increases the complexity by adding more layers and alternating operations, making it a more challenging problem than the original. It also emphasizes the need for meticulous step-by-step processing, which is a valuable skill in mathematics."}

The solution correctly identifies that 8 is the number because it's even, so its smallest prime factor is 2, which is the smallest possible since 2 is the first prime number. That makes sense because even numbers are divisible by 2, and primes like 7, 11, 13 don't have any smaller prime factors than themselves. The number 9 has 3 as its smallest prime factor, which is bigger than 2, so 8 is the right answer.\n\nNow, to complexify this problem, I need to create a similar problem but with a higher level of difficulty. Let me think about what makes the problem more complex. In the original problem, the set includes both prime numbers and composite numbers, and the composite numbers have small prime factors, making it straightforward because 2 is the smallest prime. To make it more challenging, perhaps I can make the set consist of larger numbers where the smallest prime factors aren't as obvious, or include numbers that have higher prime factors but also include a number with a small prime factor like 2 or 3.\n\nWait, the Complexified Problem given is Set B = {55, 57, 58, 59, 61}. Let's analyze this. The numbers are all in the 50s and 60s, so they're larger. This requires the solver to perform more division steps to find their prime factors. For example, 55 is 5×11, 57 is 3×19, 58 is 2×29, and 59 and 61 are primes. So, the prime factors here are 5, 3, 2, 59, and 61. The smallest is 2, which is in 58. This increases the complexity because the numbers are larger, and the primes involved are bigger, so it's not immediately obvious which composite number has the smallest prime factor without factoring them.\n\nAnother way to complexify could be to include numbers with multiple prime factors or even higher primes, but the given Complexified Problem seems to fit well as it requires more computation to factor each number. It also includes a mix of primes and composites, making it necessary to check each number thoroughly. This shift from small numbers to larger ones makes the problem more challenging because the solver has to perform more detailed calculations or recall more multiplication tables.\n\nI think the key here is to maintain the structure of the original problem but use larger numbers where the prime factors aren't as immediately apparent. This forces the solver to go through a more detailed process of elimination or factorization, which is a good way to increase complexity without changing the problem's nature too much. It also tests the solver's ability to factor larger numbers, which is a useful skill in number theory.\n\nSo, in summary, the transformation involved selecting a set of numbers that are larger than the original set, ensuring that some are composite with varying prime factors and some are primes. This requires the solver to perform more in-depth analysis to determine the smallest prime factor among them, thereby increasing the problem's difficulty compared to the original."}
