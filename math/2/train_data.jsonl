The original problem is about converting inches on a map to actual miles using a scale. It seems straightforward, but maybe I can make it even simpler by using a more basic operation.\n\nFirst, I notice that the original solution uses multiplication: 15 inches times 5 miles per inch. Multiplication is a fundamental arithmetic operation, but perhaps breaking it down further could help someone understand it better, especially a younger student.\n\nI can think of multiplication as repeated addition. So, instead of directly multiplying 15 by 5, I can explain it by adding 5 miles fifteen times. That way, the problem becomes more tangible and uses a concept that's usually introduced before multiplication.\n\nSo, I'll rephrase the problem to focus on adding 5 miles multiple times. The simplified problem would ask how many miles are equivalent to 15 inches if each inch is 5 miles. Then, in the solution, I'll show the addition step by step, adding 5 fifteen times to get the total.\n\nThis approach reduces the problem to basic addition, which is more accessible for learners who might not be comfortable with multiplication yet. It also visually demonstrates how each inch contributes to the total distance, making the concept of scale more concrete.\n\nI think this method effectively simplifies the problem without losing the core idea. It maintains the unique answer of 75 miles but approaches it through a more foundational mathematical process.\n</think>\n\n**Simplified Problem**:\nIf 1 inch on a map equals 5 miles, how many miles is 15 inches?\n\n**Simplified Solution**:\nTo find the actual distance, add 5 miles for each inch.\n\n5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 75 miles\n\nThe actual distance between the cities is \\boxed{75\\text{ miles}}.", "complex_process": "**Step-by-Step Explanation and Proof:**\n\n1. **Understand the Scale:**\n   - The map scale is \\( 1 \\text{ inch} = 5 \\text{ miles} \\).\n\n2. **Determine the Map Distance:**\n   - The distance between the two cities on the map is \\( 15 \\text{ inches} \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Actual Distance:**\n   - Multiply the map distance by the scale factor to find the actual distance.\n   \\[\n   15 \\text{ inches} \\times 5 \\frac{\\text{miles}}{\\text{inch}} = 75 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Final Answer:**\n   - The actual distance between the two cities is \\(\\boxed{75\\text{ miles}}\\)."}
